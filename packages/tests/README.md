# CLI e2e Tests

This package runs fixture-based end-to-end tests for the local `shadcn-svelte` CLI.

The tests copy starter templates into `packages/tests/temp`, serve `docs/static` as a local registry, and execute the built CLI with `REGISTRY_URL` pointed at that local server. They do not install template dependencies.

Run the suite from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

For type checking only:

```bash
pnpm -F @shadcn-svelte/e2e-tests typecheck
```
