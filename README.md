# shadcn-svelte-lab

> [!WARNING]
> `shadcn-svelte-lab` is a heavily modified fork of [huntabyte/shadcn-svelte](https://github.com/huntabyte/shadcn-svelte), which is the Svelte port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).
>
> It is not the canonical shadcn-svelte project, it is not affiliated with shadcn, and it is not affiliated with the upstream shadcn-svelte maintainers. This lab is not expected to be maintained regularly. Treat it as an experimental reference, not as the safest production starting point.

This lab explores how current [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) registry, CLI, agent, and documentation ideas can be adapted to Svelte. The component layer still uses Svelte-native primitives, primarily [Bits UI](https://bits-ui.com), but the CLI and registry platform have been changed substantially.

Use `shadcn/ui` for React projects. Use canonical `shadcn-svelte` for production Svelte projects that need the maintained upstream path. Use `shadcn-svelte-lab` for research, comparison, local experiments, and one-off internal use.

## Why This Lab Exists

`shadcn-svelte-lab` keeps the Svelte component model from `shadcn-svelte`, then explores a broader registry and agent workflow:

- Svelte-native components, blocks, charts, styles, and starter templates.
- Registry namespace support through `components.json` `registries`.
- Registry search, view, docs, info, and MCP surfaces for agent workflows.
- Registry authentication configuration for private registries.
- Additional CLI commands for presets, applying presets, registry builds, migrations, and ejecting bundled CSS.
- SvelteKit, Vite, Astro, and monorepo starter templates.
- Fixture-based CLI e2e tests in `packages/tests`.

The package names and many command examples still use `shadcn-svelte` because this lab started from that project. That name inheritance should not be read as upstream ownership or a maintenance promise.

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build the CLI:

```bash
pnpm build:cli
```

Run the CLI unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run the fixture-based e2e suite:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

Build the docs site:

```bash
pnpm build:docs
```

## Documentation

The docs in this repository describe this lab's current behavior. For canonical project documentation, use:

- [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)
- [shadcn-svelte documentation](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs)

If this lab drifts from those sources, prefer the canonical upstream docs unless you are intentionally working with this repository's changed CLI and registry platform.

## Project Name

The chosen project name is `shadcn-svelte-lab`.

That name is intentionally modest. It signals that this is an experiment and not a replacement for the canonical Svelte port.

If the npm package is ever published from this lab, use a scoped package name that identifies the owner, for example `@aihxp/shadcn-svelte-lab`. Publishing under the unscoped `shadcn-svelte` name would imply continuity with the upstream package and should be avoided.
